 *
 * name: is the name of the device on which this FTL should run, so
 * your /dev/xxx device.
 *
 * log_zone: is the number of zones your FTL should use to implement a
 * Log. The remaining are for the Data zone. The default value is 3.
 * We will test with various possible values between 3-X (X is
 * determined by the number of total zones available on a device).
 *
 * gc_wmark: is the GC watermark, the number of minimum free zones
 * that the GC must maintain. You are free to start GC before you get
 * to this value, but at this value GC must be running and cleaning
 * zones. The default value is 1. So when the last zone is left free
 * (out of the 3), clean up some space from the Log by converting some
 * mapping from Log to Data.
 *
 * force_reset: If true, then always reset the whole device before
 * using. This is the default behavior. Changing this come in handy
 * for M5 when using persistency. You do not have to touch this
 * variable for M2-M3, but implement this behavior to reset the whole
 * device.
